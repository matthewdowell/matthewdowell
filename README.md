## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:

I am a curious learner, effective teammate, and always willing to put in the work to get things done. I have a strong desire to have impact on peopleâ€™s lives and the world. I wanted to challenge myself in new ways and recently decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I love to problem solve and think critically about the world. Since attending Hack Reactorâ€™s intensive software engineering immersive program, I couldnâ€™t be happier with my decision to pursue this career. I find it very challenging and rewarding. I thoroughly enjoy branching out, learning new technologies, and Iâ€™ve noticed that there are always endless opportunities to learn and grow.

I've quickly become a full stack software engineer with the following skillset:

**Front End** - JavaScript (ES5 and ES6), React, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Redux, Material UI

**Back End** - Node.js, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Passport.js, RESTful API Development

**Testing/Deployment** - Jest, Mocha, Chai, AWS: EC2, NginX, K6, Loader.io

**Developer Tools** - Vim, Git, npm, Webpack, Babel, Agile Methodology, TDD

I am currently seeking new software engineering opportunities. Feel free to message me anytime if you're interested in discussing potential roles or projects!
